It distinguishes between the capabilities of an Administrator and an Author, explains the process of creating custom user roles, assigning them to users, and details the necessary precautions and steps to delete a user role. The article emphasizes the importance of role management in maintaining system security and ensuring that users have appropriate access levels for their responsibilities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HHQHTK59SH64HAQQPWB3P08M\">Information</h1>\n<article id=\"fullArticle\">\n<p>As your Advocate Marketing program grows, you may need to seek help from members of your organization to manage some day to day tasks. With Role Management, you have the ability to give users certain permissions, while restricting their access to other areas of your AdvocateHub.</p>\n<p>The two default system roles are the Administrator and the Author. Authors have most of the abilities of a regular administrator, but lack the ability to publish or approve challenges and rewards - you can <a href=\"http://influitive.helpscoutdocs.com/article/98-author-user-types\"> learn more about them here</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#admin\">Permissions of Admin vs Author </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#user\"> Creating a User Role </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01HHQHXDJFKHYE466AJ4SCG9FB\"> Assigning Roles </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01HHQHXRJE21CKXJVZGBYMFE56\"> Deleting a User Role </a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"admin\">Permissions of Admin vs Author</h3>\n<p>Admins can do every action in the hub, however, Authors have a smaller set of permissions. Authors can complete the following</p>\n<p><strong> Can: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create Challenges</li>\n<li>Create Rewards</li>\n<li>Create Groups</li>\n<li>Delete Groups</li>\n<li>Edit Groups</li>\n<li>Add Nominee</li>\n<li>Invite Nominees</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> Can’t: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publish Challenges</li>\n<li>Publish Rewards</li>\n<li>Modify Reward Visibility</li>\n<li>Approve / Reject Challenges</li>\n<li>Fulfill Rewards</li>\n<li>Access Settings section</li>\n<li>Publish Experiences</li>\n<li>API Access (Any option)</li>\n<li>View Reports</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>Essentially the author can create in the hub but can’t publish anything to the advocates, so an admin can confirm everything that goes to the advocates. If you want a user with slightly more or less permissions, like an editor or just a group admin you can create custom users with different permission sets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"user\"><strong> Creating a User Role </strong></h3>\n<img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" data-type=\"inline\" data-uuid=\"Z4paUb8mHPzteVbGxx8C2q\" data-v=\"4\" src=\"https://csai-curator-images.s3.amazonaws.com/15751277958162_image_72.png\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;\">\n<p>Begin by navigating to <strong style=\"background-color: initial;\"> Settings &gt; System &gt; Role Management </strong> .

Disable the toggle if you do not want this role to have access to the Lens Tool.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HHQHTK592GQQBR3NPW4MFY37\"><strong> 2. Allow Member Interaction. </strong></h3>\n<p>This permission allows administrators to interact with members via messaging, discussions, content sections, and public challenge responses. When disabled, the administrators will not be able to participate in Discussions or message Hub members.</p>\n<p>Member Interaction when enabled, the administrator will be able to click on Hub member's name and message them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://csai-curator-images.s3.amazonaws.com/15751277958162_image_75.png\" style=\"width: 254.989px;\"></p>\n<p>Member Interaction disabled, the administrator will only be able to view the Hub member's profile.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://csai-curator-images.s3.amazonaws.com/15751277958162_image_76.png\" style=\"width: 270.989px;\"></p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: initial; font-family: inherit; font-size: 21px;\"> 3.

Allow Administrative View Access. </strong></h3>\n<p>Disabling this permission would allow creating roles that cannot have access to your Hub administrators settings but will still be able to browse or demo the Hub. You can disable this toggle if you would like to create a role for your executive shareholders and other departments to use.</p>\n<p>If enabled, there are more specific administrative functions and permissions for you to choose:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://csai-curator-images.s3.amazonaws.com/15751277958162_image_78.png\" style=\"width: 569px;\"></p>\n<p class=\"callout-yellow\"><strong> Note: </strong> Enabling <strong> Manage Users </strong> will give Admins access to the settings \"Admin User Management\" and \"Reset Password Link\" found in <strong> Settings &gt; System </strong> . Enabling <strong> Manage Roles </strong> will give Admins access to the setting \"Role Management\" found in the same location.</p>\n<p>4. Click <strong> Create Role </strong> .</p>\n<p><strong> Note </strong> : The base-level permissions of a custom made role are the same as the 'Author' role. This is called the General User Permission which includes abilities to browse all Challenges, Rewards, Content Pages, and Referral Campaigns, participate and moderate discussion forums, send and receive messages from members and update their public profile.</p>\n<h3 id=\"assign\"> </h3>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HHQHXDJFKHYE466AJ4SCG9FB\"><strong>Assigning Roles</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you create the user role it will be available when you add a user in the <strong> User Management </strong> settings page ( <strong> Settings &gt; System &gt; User Management </strong> ).

You can then define the specific permissions and access levels for the new role.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HHQHTK59WD39G6D7MV3K4DEP\">Can I delete a user role that has users associated with it?</h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">No, roles with associated users cannot be deleted directly. You must first reassign the users to a different role before you can delete the original role.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HHQHTK59DT1BBHQMMGFJQNSN\">What should I do if I want to limit a user's access to sensitive administrative areas within the hub?</h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">You can create a role without access to Hub administrators settings by disabling the 'Allow Administrative View Access' permission. This is suitable for roles intended for executive shareholders and other departments who need to browse or demo the Hub without viewing sensitive areas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HHQHTK590EEGY3G4SBBFWDYF\">Is it possible to customize API access for different user roles?</h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">Yes, enabling the 'Allow API Access' permission allows you to customize the options for API access based on the role, ensuring that users have the necessary API functions according to their responsibilities.</p>",
