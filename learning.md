# Kayako Voice Assistant Implementation Features

## Understanding the Core Architecture

Before diving into specific features, it's important to understand why we chose certain technologies and architectures:

### Why Real-time Communication?
Traditional HTTP request-response cycles aren't suitable for voice applications because:
- They introduce latency between each interaction
- They don't support continuous streaming of audio
- They can't handle bidirectional communication efficiently

This is why we chose WebSocket-based communication, which provides:
- Persistent connections between client and server
- Real-time bidirectional data flow
- Lower latency and overhead
- Better support for streaming audio data

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation

### 1. Chunking Mechanism
Chunking is crucial for effective document retrieval. Here's why:
- Large documents are difficult to embed effectively
- Context windows have size limitations
- Relevant information might be buried in large texts

Our implementation uses:
- Custom text chunking with configurable size (default 500) and overlap (50)
  - 500 characters balances context preservation with precision
  - 50 character overlap prevents context loss at boundaries
- Sentence-boundary aware splitting
  - Preserves natural language structure
  - Prevents mid-sentence breaks that could lose context
- Special handling for long sentences
  - Prevents oversized chunks
  - Maintains readability
- HTML to plain text conversion using html2text
  - Removes formatting while preserving structure
  - Makes text suitable for embedding
- Text cleaning
  - Removes special characters that could confuse the model
  - Normalizes whitespace for consistent processing

### 2. Embedding System
Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. We chose OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model because:
- It provides excellent semantic understanding
- It's cost-effective for production use
- It handles multiple languages well

Our implementation:
- Creates embeddings for chunks rather than full documents
  - More precise similarity matching
  - Better memory efficiency
  - Faster retrieval
- Uses dot product for similarity calculation
  - Computationally efficient
  - Works well with normalized vectors
- Includes debug logging
  - Helps track similarity scores
  - Aids in system optimization

### 3. Document Retrieval
The retrieval system is designed to balance accuracy with performance:
- Top-K retrieval (default k=3)
  - Provides enough context without overwhelming
  - Allows for multiple relevant sources
- Title-based deduplication
  - Prevents repetitive information
  - Maintains diversity in results
- No explicit similarity threshold
  - Lets the LLM determine relevance
  - More flexible for edge cases

## Conversation Management

### 1. System Prompting
Prompt engineering is crucial for controlling AI behavior. Our system prompt:
- Focuses on phone conversation requirements
  - Short, clear responses
  - Natural speaking style
  - Actionable information
- Controls response length
  - 3-4 sentences target
  - Balances brevity with completeness
- Evaluates documentation relevance
  - Prevents hallucination
  - Ensures accurate responses

### 2. Intent Classification
- Five distinct intents: END_CALL, CONTINUE, CONNECT_HUMAN, OFF_TOPIC, UNCLEAR
- Context-aware classification
- Example-based prompt for better accuracy
- Automatic human handoff triggers

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Quality Control
- Debug logging throughout the pipeline
- Error handling for embedding creation
- Chunk size validation and management
- Conversation length monitoring

### 2. Content Processing
- HTML stripping
- Text normalization
- Sentence boundary detection
- Chunk overlap management
- Title preservation in chunks

### 3. Support Ticket Creation
- Automated ticket summarization
- Structured format (Issue, Resolution, Follow-ups, Key Points)
- Conversation transcript processing

## Optimizations

### 1. Memory Efficiency
- Chunk-based processing instead of full documents
- Title deduplication in results
- Configurable chunk sizes

### 2. Retrieval Quality
- Sentence-aware chunking
- Overlap between chunks to maintain context
- Similarity scoring with logging
- Title-based result deduplication
